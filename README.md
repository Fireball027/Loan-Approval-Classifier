## Overview

The **Loan Application Classification Project** aims to classify loan applications as either **approved or rejected** using machine learning models. The dataset consists of **1,000 loan applicants** with **20 feature variables per applicant**. Out of these, **13 attributes** take discrete values, while **three attributes** accept continuous values. The goal is to extract the most influential attributes and employ them in an efficient classification model.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and balances the dataset for better model accuracy.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifies crucial attributes impacting loan classification.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes classification algorithms for predicting loan approval.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- **Web Application**: Integrates with **Streamlit** for an interactive user experience.

## Project Files

### 1. `prediction.py`
This script processes the dataset, trains a classification model, and predicts loan approvals.

#### Key Components:

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Reads the German Credit Dataset.
  - Handles missing values and encodes categorical features.
  - Performs feature selection for improved performance.

- **Machine Learning Model**:
  - Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - Implements classifiers such as **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM**.
  - Evaluates model performance using **accuracy and confusion matrix**.

- **Web Application**:
  - Deploys an interactive dashboard using **Streamlit**.
  - Allows users to input applicant details and receive loan approval predictions.

#### Example Code:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import joblib
import streamlit as st
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('german_credit_data.csv')

# Preprocessing
data.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)
X = data.drop('Loan_Status', axis=1)
y = data['Loan_Status']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Save model
joblib.dump(model, 'loan_classifier.pkl')
```
